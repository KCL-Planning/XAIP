      <p><b>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)</b> concerns the challenge of shedding light on opaque models in contexts for which transparency is important, i.e. where these models could be used to solve analysis or synthesis tasks. In particular, as AI is increasingly being adopted into application solutions, the challenge of supporting interaction with humans is becoming more apparent.</p>
      <p>Within this space, <b>Explainable Planning (XAIP)</b> is receiving growing attention, as showed by the successful editions of the ICAPS Workshop on Explainable Planning that started in 2018.</p>
      <p>This website is intended to be a stable repository for the content of those workshops, as well as a pointer to related work in this domain.</p>
      <br><p>Information about the current ICAPS XAIP workshop can be found <a href="https://kcl-planning.github.io/XAIP-Workshops/ICAPS_2019">here</a>, while information about past ICAPS XAIP workshops can be found <a href="https://kcl-planning.github.io/XAIP-Workshops/archive">here</a>.</p>
