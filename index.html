      <b>2019 ICAPS XAIP Workshop</b> <font size="-1">Berkeley, CA (details to come)</font><br><br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Mission:</b><br><font size="-1">Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) concerns the challenge of shedding light on opaque models in contexts for which transparency is important, i.e. where these models could be used to solve analysis or synthesis tasks. In particular, as AI is increasingly being adopted into application solutions, the challenge of supporting interaction with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is to support integrated working styles, in which humans and intelligent systems cooperate in problem-solving, but also it is a necessary step in the process of building trust as humans migrate greater competence and responsibility to such systems. The challenge is to find effective ways to characterise, and to communicate, the foundations of AI-driven behaviour, when the algorithms that drive it are far from transparent to humans. While XAI at large is primarily concerned with learning-based approaches, model-based approaches are well suited -- arguably better suited -- for explanation, and Explainable AI Planning (XAIP) can play an important role in addressing complex decision-making procedures. <br><br>
            After the success of previous workshops on XAI and XAIP, the mission of this workshop is to mature and broaden the XAIP community, fostering continued exchange on XAIP topics at ICAPS.</font></li><br>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Mission:</b><br><font size="-1"> As AI is increasingly being adopted into application solutions, the challenge of supporting interaction with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is to support integrated working styles, in which humans and intelligent systems cooperate in problem-solving, but it is also a necessary step in the process of building trust as humans invest greater authority and responsibility in intelligent systems. Explainability poses challenges for many types of AI systems, including planning and scheduling (PS) systems. For example, how should a PS system justify that a plan or schedule is correct, or good, or respects supplied preferences? How can the PS system explain particular steps, ordering decisions, or resource choices? How can a PS system explain that no solution is possible, or what relaxations of the constraints would allow a solution? How can a PS system respond to questions like “what is the hard part?” or “why is this taking so long?”. These are all difficult questions that can require analysis of plan or schedule structure, analysis of the goals, constraints, and preferences, and potentially hypothetical reasoning.</font></li><br>

            Relating XAI (Explainable AI) to XAIP (XAI Planning)<br><br>
            <i>The DARPA Explainable AI (XAI) program is a high-profile effort, among many, whose objective is to encourage research on AI systems whose models and decisions are more accessible and transparent to users. Yet the common focus of DARPA XAI's 11 projects is machine learning; it could have been called XML rather than XAI. Still, it is raising awareness that AI researchers need to collaborate with social scientists, and others, on the design and evaluation of XAI systems. This also applies broadly to other XAI efforts, including those of interest to the ICAPS community. In this talk, I'll summarize the objectives and status of DARPA XAI, emphasizing some topics of interest to XAIP. I'll also discuss/relate some work on XAIP that has appeared at the IJCAI-17 XAI Workshop, or will appear at the upcoming IJCAI/ECAI-18 XAI Workshop, which has a broad XAI focus (i.e., not limited to ML).</i></font></li><br>
