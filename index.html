      <p>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) concerns the challenge of shedding light on opaque models where transparency is important, e.g. in analysis or synthesis tasks. In particular, as AI is increasingly being adopted for deployed applications, the challenge of supporting interaction with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is to support collaborations with humans but also it is a necessary step in the process of building trust as humans migrate greater competence and responsibility to AI systems. The challenge is to find effective ways to characterize and communicate the foundations of AI-driven behavior when the algorithms that drive it are far from transparent to humans. While XAI at large is primarily concerned with learning-based approaches, model-based <strong>Explainable AI Planning (XAIP)</strong> can play an important role in addressing complex decision-making procedures.</p>
